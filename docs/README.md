# SQUAT manual
---

## version: 1.0

This manual introduces all the information you need to know about SQUAT.

SQUAT stands for **Sequencing QUality Assessment Tool**. It allows users to examine their sequencing data and determine if they are truly representative of the original specie based on data assessments before and after genome assemblies. 

The tool aligns sequencing reads against the assembly with **[BWA](http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net/)** and generates one pre-assembly and one post-assembly report at the end of the analysis.

Version 1.0 of SQUAT was released under GPLv3.
